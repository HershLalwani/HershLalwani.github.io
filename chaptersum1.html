                A judge, Justice Wargrave, is aboard a train reading a newspaper about a newly purchased Island, Solider Island. 
                It said in the paper that it had been recently purchased by a Mr. Owen. 
                Some rumors had started about who actually owned the island, which all had different people in mind, a famous film star, royalty, for a couple's honeymoon, or by the Admiralty for experiements.
                The Justice reads a letter he had recieved from Constance Culmington that invited him to the island to talk and catch up. After thinking about how long it had been since they last saw each other, he dozes off.

                In another part of the train Vera Claythorne, a games mistress at a school, has also recieved a letter inviting her to Solider Island. This letter was signed by a different person than the letter to Justice Wargrave, by a Una Nancy Owen.
                The thought of going to the sea was not easy for her as she had lost her ex lover at sea. After some thought she opened her eyes to a man sitting across from her.

                The man was Philip Lombard, he thought she was admiring her beauty but quickly focuses back on to the subject of his trip. Captain Lombard was also invited to Solider Island, but again by a different person. This time it was by a Mr. Isaac Morris.
                Mr. Morris offered Lombard a hundred guineas to go there and due to the amount at stake, Lombard agreed.

                Another guest is introduced with Miss Emily Brent, a very righteous woman with no idea of relaxation. Her invitation to Solider Island was also by a letter, signed by U.N.O--. 
                The writer of the letter introduces themselves as an aquaintance to Miss Brent from a couple years ago at Belhaven Guest House. She tries to remember what the name was of the person she met with the last name of O. She thought of an Oliver.

                Looking out of the carriage window was a man named General Macarthur. He had also been invited by an Owen, claiming that he was a friend of Spoof Leggard. The letter states that there will be some of his old friends at the island.
                Macarthur broods about an old rumor that had been spread by a new war official. The general seems to be interested in Solider Island due to the rumors that it had been occupied by the Admirality or a military group.

                The next guest to be introduced is Dr. Armstrong. A successful man in his field of work. The letter he recieved, accompanied with a cheque of a large amount, was from the Owens claiming that the wife has some uncommon condition and they need a doctor to get her treated right.
                Dr. Armstrong had been in a near life threatening car crash which shocked him to pull himself together and led to him being a great doctor.

                In a car, Tony Marston, rushes down to Oakbridge like the rest of the guest. He had also been invited by the Owens, but he was looking forward to the island being owned by Gabrielle Turl so he would be in the film star crowd.
                After getting a drink he continues on his journey.

                Mr. Blore was in a train like most of the other guests but he was counting in his notebook all of the guests that have been invited to the island. He plans to pretend to be from South Africa so no one reconizes him.
                He remembers Solider Island from when he was a kid beacuse he had been there before. Just as hes finished remembering, An old man wakes up and warns Mr. Blore about a squall up ahead.
