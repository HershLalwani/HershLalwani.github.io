                Chapter 11:
            </h4>
            <p>
                As Philip Lombard awakes early he realizes that Rogers has not brought him any coffee so he goes out to Blore's room. He tells Blore that Rogers is missing and they start to look for him. They find the china figures have been reduced to six and his body is in the washhouse, killed by a chopper. Vera is in shock and is laughing nervously while asking Lombard and Blore if there are any bees on the island. She points out that the next murder is going to have something to do with bees according to the poem. Once they're inside, Blore talks to Lombard and points the blame on Brent who has been calm and collected the whole time. Emily Brent is not afraid of death here because she was sure she wasn't going to die here. She had been proper and done nothing that she thought was wrong.

            <h4>
                Chapter 12:
            </h4>
            <p>
                As the rest of the guests go to discuss who the murderer could be after the killing of Rogers, Brent stays in the Drawing room. In the conclave, Blore mentions that Brent could be the killer for giving the least explanation and being the calmest of them all. They later go to fetch her and find her dead. Dr. Armstrong notices that she has been injected with a hypodermic syringe, which only Armstrong brought to the Island. They decide to confiscate every dangerous item brought by the guests including the medicines from Armstrong and the gun from Lombard. When they try to take the gun from Lombard, it is supposed to be in his bedside drawer but is currently missing. All other dangerous items were confiscated and put in a case. They also find the syringe along with the broken sixth china figure.
