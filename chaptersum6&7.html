                Chapter 6:

            <p>
                Armstrong is having a dream about operating while he's drunk but the people he's operating on are the guests at Solider Island. He's promptly woken up by Mr. Rogers who is pleading for help because his wife is not waking up. Ms. Rogers had passed away while sleeping, Mr. Rogers guessed it was something with her heart but Armstrong guessed it was a pill that she took to help her sleep better. The gong for breakfast is sounded after this discovery as they're all called down. The boat that the guests are waiting to leave on has not arrived yet in the morning and Lombard says there's going to be a storm before the day is done. After breakfast, Armstrong reveals to the rest of the guests what had happened this morning with Ms. Rogers and Blore instantly pins the blame onto Mr. Rogers who would be the only one to kill his wife to save his neck after the accusations. While Macarthur disagrees that a man would murder his own. At around ten o'clock, the guests speculate that this whole island is a trap to bring them here and the boat is not arriving again. Mr. Rogers calls Armstrong aside to reveal to him that the china figures are now down to eight after the death of Ms. Rogers.

                Chapter 7:
            </h4>
            <p>
                Emily and Vera both sit and talk about if the Rodgers did indeed do away with the old lady, Emily is sure of it that they did and Vera fears that if that accusation is true, then are the rest of them true as well. This is when Emily reveals to Vera what happened to Beatrice Taylor. Emily had pushed Beatrice too hard and she took her own life by jumping into the river. Emily feels no remorse for the action and is not haunted by it in the least. Vera now sees Emily as less of a strange old lady and more of a terrible one.

                Armstrong chooses one more person to talk to and give some information to, he chooses Lombard due to him being a reasonable man. Armstrong asks Lombard how likely is it that two suicides could happen in one day, Lombard says it doesn't add up and it's too much of a coincidence. Armstrong then tells him about the china figures and Lombard agrees that that must be the plan. The U.N.Owen must be gathering them here and murdering each of them for their wrongfulness that cannot be dealt with in the outside world.
