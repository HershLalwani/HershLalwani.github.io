                As the rest of the guests go to discuss who the murderer could be after the killing of Rogers, Brent stays in the Drawing room. In the conclave, Blore mentions that Brent could be the killer for giving the least explaination and being the calmest of them all. 
                They later go to fetch her and find her dead. Dr. Armstrong notices that she has been injected with a hyperdermic syringe, which only Armstrong brought to the Island. They decide to confescate every dangerous item brought by the guests including the medicines from Armstrong and the gun from Lombard. 
                When they try to take the gun from Lombard, it is supposed to be in his bedside drawer but is currently missing. All other dangerous items were confescated and put in a case. They also find the syringe along with the broken sixth china figure.
