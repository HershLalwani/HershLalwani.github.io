                Chapter 4:
            </h4>
            <p>
                Led by Wargrave, the guests take turns to talk about and defend themselves from the allegations put on them by the mysterious speaker. Wargrave admits that he gave an alleged murderer, Edward Seton, a death sentence due to the evidence that was stacked against him. 
                Vera continues after Wargrave and tells about how she lost track of a child, Cyrill Hamilton, at a beach and the child swam out far and drowned. Macarthur admits to sending an officer, Arthur Richmond, on a reconnaissance mission where the officer died. Most of the confessions so far seem to be a case where the guest was just doing his job.
                Philip Lombard on the other hand admits that he left the group of indians to die and starve. He feels no remorse for the act even though he is fully guilty. Same with Marston who ran over two kids, the Combes, while he was speeding, also feeling no remorse over their deaths. 
                Mr. Rogers says that Ms Brady was very ill and he was not able to fetch a doctor quick enough to save her. Mr. Blore tells of when he was a detective on the case of a Landor. Blore found evidence against Landor and was given a life sentence where he later died. 
                Armstrong is the only guest that lies about their allegations. He tells them that he cant remember the name of the patient that was killed during a surgery, when he in fact remebers that he was drunk durig the operation and could not control his nerves which caused the patient's death.
                Ms Brent does not defend herself and lets the allegations stay.

                After the defenses, most of the guests agree to leave the island as soon as Narracot's boat arrives. Marston on the other hand tells them lets enjoy the stay rather than fleeing, while he says this he takes a large swig of whiskey on which he chokes and dies on the spot. The death is further elaborated on in the next chapter.
