                Chapter 8:
            </h4>
            <p>
                Armstrong, Lombard, and Blore(who they just roped in to the talk), all talk about how Marston's murder could have been carried out. They speculate that it was the windowsil where he set his glass. 
                The three men decide to look around the island and find anything that might give them clues about any extra person or weapons. They spot the general and try speaking to him but he is depressed and gone mad.
                They speculate how they can get the attention of the people on the mainland. They continue to search around the island for places there could be a person hiding.

                Vera is still restless because of Emily and her reaction while confessing the murder. As Vera goes outside to talk with Macarthur, he hears here approaching and talks to her about his gone wife and how he sent Richmond to his death due to her. 
                Macarthur has accepted and is waiting for death by just sitting out looking to the sea when Vera asks him what hes waiting for, he says that there is no need to worry about anything anymore now that theyre all not making it off the island.
                Lombard decides to rope himself down with the help of Armstrong and Blore off a cliff that could have a cove in it. While Lombard is on the rope and not able to hear Blore, Blore tells Armstrong that Lombard might not be a trustable person due to him bringing a weapon.
                Armstrong is defending Lombard as he believes Lombard is a good man. Lombard climbs back up the cliff and tells the other two that its only the house where someone could be hiding.

                All three of them search all throughout the house and after what they thought they heard was the killer, turning out to be Rogers, they came to the conclusion that the eight of them were alone on the island.
