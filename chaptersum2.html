                At the start of the chapter the guests are all in a small crowd at the station where the train dropped them off. All of them leave with a taxi for Solider Island except for Vera Claythorne and Philip Lombard. 
                Vera has been called in as a stand in secretary for Mr. Owen. They engage in idle talk as they wait for the next guests to arrive in the next train. 
                The guest to arrive on the train is General Macarthur who quickly scans Mr. Lombard and comes to the conclusion that hes a good looking fellow but something is wrong about him. 
                The guests then went onto the small boat that would take them to the island. As they are about to leave, Anthony Marston drives up to the meet up point.

                A new guest is introduced, Fred Narracot, who doesnt seem too interested in the rest of the guests. He thought the whole set of guests were wierd and mismatched from his impressions of Mr. Owen.
                They reach the island with the guests and see house and that it lives up to its fame. They get to open door and see a proper butler who tells them Mr. Owen has been delayed and wont be here till tomorrow. The guests are told to take a room and that dinner would be at eight o'clock.
                A woman, Mrs. Rogers, goes with Vera Claythorne to open her room to find her luggage in the room and unpacked. Mrs. Rogers seems fightened from anything.
                Vera was very nervous due to the fact that the Owens were not here, there was only one married couple to take care of te 8 guests at the party, and that the guests were all sorts of wierd. 
                While she was pacing around the room she discovered the poem framed above the mantlepiece. The poem of the ten little indians. The poem explaining the 10 indians what went to dine and how they died one by one until there were none. 
                She is still haunted by her ex lover drowing in the ocean after seeing the water aroung the house.

                Dr. Armstrong arrives at Solider Island and recognizes Wargrave as he had connections with him in the past. Dr. Armstrong is also made known of the fact that the host and hostess are not present yet. Wargrave asks if Armstrong knows Constance Culmington, which he doesnt, to see if he was in the right place.
                Ms. Rogers says Constance Culmington is not a guest to come to the island. 
                During all of this talk, Anthony Marston was taking a bath, Mr. Blore was thinking to himself about his job at the island that he has to succeed at.
                General Macarthur is frustrated that it is not going as he expected and that the whole situation is wierd. Philip Lombard comes down the stairs once the gong sounds for dinner and Emily Brent who was reading the bible also goes to the main hall for dinner.
