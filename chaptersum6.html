            <p>
                Armstrong is having a dream about operating while hes drunk but the people hes operating on are the guests at Solider Island. Hes promptly woken up by Mr. Rogers who is pleading for help because his wife is not waking up.
                Ms. Rogers had passed away while sleeping, Mr. Rogers guessed it was something with her heart but Armstrong guessed it was a pill that she took to help her sleep better. The gong for breakfast is sounded after this discovery as theyre all called down.
                The boat that the guests are waiting to leave on has not arrived yet in the morning and Lombard says theres going to be a storm before the day is done. After breakfast, Armstrong reveals to the rest of the guests what had happened this morning with Ms. Rogers and Blore instantly pins the blame onto Mr. Rogers who would be the only one to kill his wife to save his own neck after the accusations.
                While Macarthur disagress that a man would murder his own wife. At around ten o'clock, the guests speculate that this whole island is a trap to bring them here and the boat is not ariving again. Mr. Rogers calls Armstrong aside to reveal to him that the china figures are now down to eight after the death of Ms. Rogers.
