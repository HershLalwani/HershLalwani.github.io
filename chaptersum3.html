            <p>
                Everyone at dinner was getting comfortable with each other and begining to talk amongst each other. Wargrave talking to Armstrong and Marston, Miss Brent talked with Macarthur and Vera was talking with Mr. Davis(Mr. Blore).
                Marston notices the china in the center of the dining table and the guests talk about the 10 soliders in the china and the poem on their wall.
                Ms. Brent and Vera both leave the dining table to go talk in a room about the situation. Vera says shes hates it and how the place wouldnt be safe during a storm. During this conversation, Ms Brent says the name that she thought was on the letter, Mr. Oliver.
                Vera clarifies that it is Mr. Owen and Ms. Brent is shocked by the information as the rest of the guests join the ladies in the room.

                Just then, there is a voice playing throughout the house, stating the guests' indictments. Charging each of the guests with some sort of murder/death of another person. 
                As soon as the voice stops, there is a large thud heard outisde of the room and panic ensues. Mrs. Rogers had fallen unresponsive, Lombard and Marston helped get her up to Armstrong who was taking care of her.
                As the guests try to make a sense of what is happening, they decide that this Mr. Owen is a mystery they must solve for playing this "joke" with a gramophone on them. Wargrave started questioning Mr. Rogers on who Mr. Owen is, while Rogers answers that he has never met him due to him ariving a week earlier.
                Taking turns the guests explain how they were called here, this is when the blame turns to Mr. Blore who was still Mr. Davis to the rest of them. Wargrave deduced that in the audio from the gramophone there was no mention of a Davis but rather of a Blore. This is when his identity is revealed as a detective employed by an Owen.
