                The guests had stayed together and changed a bit due to only five of them being left. All of the guests stay together and think in their heads all stuck on the same topic, who is it? 
                Vera left the group to go wash her head and temple due to the stress of the situation. While she went into her room and the other 4 stayed back, she felt so paranoid that a wet seaweed in a dark room made her think a hand was touching her and that she was going to die.
                After the men went to help Vera and giving her some brandy, they notice that Wargrave is missing. They then find him in a hall shot in the head with a bullet. After Wargrave's death has been revealed, Lombard's reaction gave the rest of them a shock(see character summary/analysis for details).

                The remaining four eat food in the kitchen while they think who is the killer. They all went to bed after the fright with Wargrave, into their own rooms and locking their door. Lombard in his room gets ready for bed and finds his revolver back in the drawer. Blore while getting ready for bed hears a footstep outside his door and then hears footsteps going down the stairs. 
                Ge exits the room to try to find out who the killer is. He gets both Vera and Lombard to find Armstrong who is missing. Lombard reveales to Blore that he has the revolver again, and the two men go to find Armstrong. 
                They come back and tell vera that Armstrong has vanished from the Island and that there are only three solider boys on the table.
