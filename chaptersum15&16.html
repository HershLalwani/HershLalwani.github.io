                Chapter 15:
            </h4>
            <p>
                The next morning comes around and the three remaining guests make sense of Armstrong's disappearance. After some argument between Lombard and Blore, Vera points out that the nursery rhyme is a clue that Armstrong's death was faked and that he is U.N.Owen. After all three spend time outside Blore mentions lunch and goes inside to get some while Vera and Lombard stay outside in the open. Vera and Lombard talk about trusting each other and questioning Blore as U.N.Owen as he is the only one left in question that could have killed Armstrong. They heard a thud and went to check out the noise to find Blore's head crushed by a marble block that was dropped from a window. They decide to stay outside and wait for as long as possible for the murderer to come out. It is then when Vera spots what she thinks are clothes on a rock but as they get closer they recognize that it is Armstrong, dead.

                Chapter 16:
            </h4>
            <p>
                This was the moment when they both, Vera and Lombard, think the other is U.N.Owen and are talking about this being the end. Vera distracts Lombard by telling him that she wants to take Armstrong's body out of the wedge, while doing so she pickpockets the gun and shoots him once he tries to take it back. She feels relieved that she is the last one alive with the other nine dead. She goes back into the house now that she was free from fear. She decides to get something to eat and notices that there are still three china figures on the table so she takes two of them and tosses them out the window while taking the last one to bed with her. She tries to remember the last verse of the poem and she recalls it as "he got married and then there were none" she hallucinates about Hugo being in the house again and goes to her room to sleep. She finds a noose in that room and remembers the real ending to the poem where the soldier boy hangs himself, and like a robot, while thinking of Hugo and Cyril, she hangs herself.
