            A judge, Justice Wargrave, is aboard a train reading a newspaper about a newly purchased Island, Solider Island. 
            It said in the paper that it had been recently purchased by a Mr. Owen. 
            Some rumors had started about who actually owned the island, which all had different people in mind, a famous film star, royalty, for a couple's honeymoon, or by the Admiralty for experiements.
            The Justice reads a letter he had recieved from Constance Culmington that invited him to the island to talk and catch up. After thinking about how long it had been since they last saw each other, he dozes off.

            In another part of the train Vera Claythorne, a games mistress at a school, has also recieved a letter inviting her to Solider Island. This letter was signed by a different person than the letter to Justice Wargrave, by a Una Nancy Owen.
