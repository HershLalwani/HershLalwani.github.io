                All the guests were shocked at the death of Anthony Marston as he just choked on the spot. Dr. Armstrong claims that it must have been some kind of cyinide that killed him making the cause suicide. 
                The rest of the guests didnt believe that Marston would suicide in the prime of his life. They decided to leave the situation as is and lay Marston in his bed. 
                Due to it being late in the evening they decide to sleep for now and handle the situation later. They retire for the night and lock their separate rooms' doors.

                In the dining room, Rogers noticies that one of the china figures were missing. Macarthur thought about Richmond and how he was killed in action. Turns out, Macarthur's wife had been cheating on him with Richmond and that caused Macarthur to rage and send Richmond on a mission that would most likely result in his death.
                Macarthur thought he had done good to keep it a secret and was wondering how a mysterious voice had found him out sixteen years after the incident. Vera thinks about Cyril and how she failed to save him, she was also reminded of the framed poem and the first little soldier boys that died the same way as Marston.
