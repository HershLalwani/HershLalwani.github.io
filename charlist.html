            Character List
        </h1>

        <h4>
            Justice Lawrance Wargrave
        </h4>
        <p>
            Justice Wargrave is an old retired judge who orchestrated the whole murder. During the time the guests figured out the murderer is on the island, he was calm and his experience as a judge helped him lead the group in trying to figure out who the killer is. He is intelligent in gaining the trust of the rest of the guests who see him as a lawfully correct character.

        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
            Vera Claythorne
        </h4>
        <p>
            A former governess who received a letter from Mr. Owen to be his secretary. She is haunted by her past because she killed a child, Cyril, who drowned. Her mental state throughout her time on the island is fluctuating because she has repeated hallucinations of Hugo, her former lover, and Cyril. She paid a lot of attention to the Ten Little Indians and connected it to the deaths of the guests. Since the beginning, she has been nervous and full of fear of anything that can harm her.

        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
            Philip Lombard
        </h4>
        <p>
            A former mercenary, Lombard, is a confident and collected individual among the guests. He has seen to be smart when dealing with the people around him which leads to him being the last two people alive. He seems to only be soft towards Vera because he doesn't believe her to be the murderer because of her nervousness and fear. Due to being too comfortable with Vera, he ends up the second-last one dead. He is also seen breaking his confident/bold character during the death of Brent and Wargrave and acts almost scared or nervous.

        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
            Emily Brent
        </h4>
        <p>
            A very religious woman who is proper and righteous. She was accused of killing Beatrice Taylor because she fired her from her servant job which led to her killing herself. Brent fired her because she was pregnant before her marriage. Brent did not see this as her fault as she saw it as Beatrice's sins taking her life.

        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
            Dr. Armstrong
        </h4>
        <p>
            The only medical professional who was called to the island and helps the rest understand how the guests were dying. He also helps people as they lose their heads for a short time due to shock or hysteria. He is also quite gullible as he gets tricked by Wargrave which ends up in his death.

        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
            General Macarthur
        </h4>
        <p>
            An old retired military general was invited to talk about the old times. His character has little to no will to try once two deaths have occurred on the island. He has accepted that neither he nor the rest of the guests are going to be leaving the island alive. He was accused of sending an officer to his death, the reason was that he was Macarthur's wife's lover.

        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
            Anthony Marston
        </h4>
        <p>
            A young and athletic playboy who drives fast and complains about any slow areas on the road. He shows no remorse at all for the two children he ran over while speeding.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
            William Blore
        </h4>
        <p>
            Blore is a former detective who was sent in to keep an eye out for trouble. He is also a confident and inspiring character who the other guests also look to for the next move. Though he is corrupt for framing a man, Landor, and getting the man killed, he is able to stay alive till the last three because of his guarded nature.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
            The Rogers
        </h4>
        <p>
            Mr. and Mrs. Rogers are the servants on the island and are the ones that take care of the guests. Mrs. Rogers is an easily frightened woman who is afraid of their past crime. Mr. Rogers on the other hand is a butler that stays strong even after his wife's death.
