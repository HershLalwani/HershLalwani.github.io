                Epilogue:
            </h4>
            <p>
                In the Epilogue, two detectives were looking at the case of the ten deaths on soldier island. They were not able to figure out any way that all ten of them could have died without anyone knowing who or how. 
                Even Morris on the mainland was killed and they were not able to get any information on that. The diaries and notes of the people involved were read and analyzed but even after reconstructing the deaths in order and the state of the house after all ten deaths, the two detectives were not able to crack the case. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Bonus: Wargrave was the murderer and he confesses to all of it in a bottled letter that he threw in the water off the island. The letter tells his master plan of everything including faking his death by manipulating Armstrong and then killing him later at night, and also including the reason he did this all. That reason being that he wanted to create an unsolvable case but in the name of art, he left some hints in his plan and the letter in the bottle so that someone would solve it.
