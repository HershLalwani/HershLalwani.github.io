        <h4>
            Theme:
        </h4>
        <p>
            The main theme of the book is the Twisted Justice given by Justice Wargrave. All the guests invited to the Island are murderers that are not defined as so in normal Law due to technicalities. Wargrave takes Law into his own hands and decides to deal with justice that he sees should be dealt with. The murder of General Macarthur's officer, Richmond, is counted as a casualty of war even though the officer had an incredibly low probability of returning. This theme is highlighted in the epilogue when the two detectives recognize that "U.N.Owen dealt with cases that the law couldn't touch"(Page 230).

        <h4>
            Motif:
        </h4>
        <p>
            One central motif throughout the book is the Ten Little Indians rhyme:
            <pre>
    "Ten little Indian boys went out to dine;
    One choked his little self and then there were nine.

    Nine little Indian boys sat up very late;
    One overslept himself and then there were eight.

    Eight little Indian boys traveling in Devon;
    One said he'd stay there and then there were seven.

    Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks;
    One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.

    Six little Indian boys playing with a hive;
    A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.

    Five little Indian boys going in for law;
    One got in Chancery and then there were four.

    Four little Indian boys going out to sea;
    A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.

    Three little Indian boys walking in the zoo;
    A big bear hugged one and then there were two.

    Two Little Indian boys sitting in the sun;
    One got frizzled up and then there was one.

    One little Indian boy left all alone;
    He went out and hanged himself and then there were none."

    (Pages 33-34)

            It tells how the guests are going to die, some deaths being directly like the rhyme and others being obscure with symbolism.

        <h4>
            Symbolism:
        </h4>
        <p>
            The ten china figures on the table symbolize the guests at soldier island. Each death causes a china figure to go missing and represent another dead guest. The guests catch onto this pattern after the death of General Macarthur when Vera confirms Mr. Roger's suspicion, "You're quite right, Rogers. Look for yourself. There are only seven[china figures]..."(Page 120). This symbol is even held up to the last death when Vera takes her own china figure and drops it right before hanging herself.
