                Chapter 11:
            </h4>
            <p>
                As Philip Lombard awakes early he realizes that Rogers has not brought him any coffee so he goes out to Blore's room. He tells Blore that Rogers is missing and they start to look for him. They find the china figures have been reduced to six and his body is the washouse, killed by a chopper.
                Vera is in shock and is laughing nervously while asking Lombard and Blore if there are any bees on the island. She points out that the next murder is going to have something to do with bees according to the poem. 
                Once they're inside, Blore talks to Lombard and points the blame on Brent who has been calm and collected the whole time. Emily Brent is not afraid of death here becuase she was sure she wasnt going to die here. She had been proper and done nothing that she thought was wrong.
