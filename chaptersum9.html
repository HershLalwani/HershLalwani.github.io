                Chapter 9:
            </h4>
            <p>
                The chapter begins with Armstrong, Blore, and Lombard trying to make sense of who is murdering the guests when there are no secret people on the island. Blore tries to propose the idea that maybe it was just an accident that Ms. Rogers died because Armstrong accidentally overdosed her. 
                The blame then shifts to Lombard who has a gun and both Armstrong and Blore do not to know the reason as to why he has a gun. They question him and Lombard reveals how he was invited to the island and how it might have meant trouble for him. 
                As the guests sit in the afternoon, they notice that the waves are getting rough and a storm is coming. Right before starting lunch, all the guests arrive except for Macarthur. Armstrong goes to look for him at the usual spot he is at and comes running back saying that Macarthur is dead.
                Vera then goes straight to the dining room to see that there were only 7 china figures left. Wargrave has been watching the rest of the guests thinking about the situation. He reveals to the other guests that there is only one way this is all happening. "Mr. Owen" is the killer and he could have only gotten onto the island one way, being on of the guests.

                Wargrave then gathers all the remaining guests to eliminate and figure out who it could have been that murdered the three victims. Going through each murder and recollecting the events that transpired. After recollecting information about the whereabouts of all the guests during the murders Wargrave comes to the conclusion that no one of the seven guests can be cleared of blame due to lack of evidence. 
                The killer is still believed to be one of the seven guests and Wargrave tells everyone to be careful.
